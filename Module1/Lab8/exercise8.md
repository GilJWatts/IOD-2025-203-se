1. User Stories (Functionalities):

US-1: Dice Selection:
As a user, I want to be able to select different types of dice (e.g., D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20, D100) so that I can simulate various tabletop game dice rolls.
US-2: Dice Rolling:
As a user, I want to be able to click a "Roll" button to generate a random number within the range of the selected dice, so that I can get a dice roll result.
US-3: Display Roll Result:
As a user, I want to see the result of the dice roll displayed clearly on the screen, so that I can easily read the outcome.
US-4: Landing Page Design:
As a user, I want the landing page to be visually appealing and easy to use, so that I have a pleasant experience.
