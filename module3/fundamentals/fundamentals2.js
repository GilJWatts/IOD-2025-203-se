// 2. Which of the below are not giving the right answer? Why are they not correct? How can we fix them?
// let three = "3";
// let four = "4";
// let thirty = "30";
// to correct, change from string to number
let three = 3;
let four = 4;
let thirty = 30;
//what is the value of the following expressions?
let addition = three + four; // Answer: 34   // wrong //concactenated 3 and 4
let multiplication = three * four; // Answer: 12   //
let division = three / four; // Answer: 0.75 //
let subtraction = three - four; // Answer: -1   //
let lessThan1 = three < four; // Answer: true //
let lessThan2 = thirty < four; // Answer: true // wrong // took first character only
